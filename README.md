# McHacks21
A simple AI ChatBot built during McHacks21

# What it does
Based on the user input into the form, the AI chatbot tokenizes the sentence and find out what kind of message it is. Currently there are 6-8 kinds of messages. Then the bot replies with a message from the tag with the highest probability.
