I am not an expert in Deep Learning. My apologies if my explanations aren't clear enough.

# Machine Learning 
## Stemming
- Each word has a pattern. We can bring all words to a root word (e.g. Whats up -> what is root word)
- We First tokenize the sentence
## Neural Network
- It only understands numbers.
- We can create an array of 0s (representing the words), and if a word appears, we change the index corresponding to the word to 1. The model can be improved if we detect the frequency of words. 
## This Neural Network
- We have about 45 input neurons, connected to 2 levels of neurons, each with 8 neurons (we can add more to increase accuracy). Each neuron is linked to each other.
- The output is in base of e, containing the probability of the tags
- The model is trained 1000 times.
